## Scripts for analyzing diatom phylotranscriptomic dataset

### R scripts

  - `check-monophyly.R`: check gene trees for monophyly of Thalassiosirales and raphid pennates

  - `Densi.mod.R`: implementation of DensiTree-style function to draw a cloud of diversification histories across a set of phylogenetic trees
  
  - `Part2_plotMultiMisse.R`: plot the DensiTree-style results

  - `plot-busco-omark.R`: plot BUSCO and OMArk completeness

  - `trees-ordination-and-consensus.R`: NMDS ordination of species trees
  
### Data QC

`compare_md5sum.pl`: compares two files with pre- and post-download md5sum values


### Transcriptome assembly

`write_rnaseq_clean_filter_jobscript.pl`: creates PBS job script for running `rnaseq_clean_filter.pl`

`rnaseq_clean_filter.pl`: pipeline for:

- correcting reads with rcorrector
- trimming and cleaning reads with Trimmomatic
- filtering vector contaminants
- filtering diatom rRNA reads
- filtering bacterial rRNA reads
- merging overlapping reads
- generating a PBS job script for assembling nuclear reads with Trinity  
- generating a PBS job script for translating assembled contigs with Transdecoder
- assembly QC with BUSCO and transrate

**Note**: this script is set up to run on the [AHPCC](http://hpc.uark.edu/hpc/) and interface with lab-specific SQL databases that store our sample information


### Filtering index crosstalk identified by [CroCo](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-018-0486-7)

`remove_croco-filtered_from_transdecoder.py`: removes CroCo-identified crosstalk (FASTA format) from Transdecoder FASTA file

`cat_croco_dubious_contam.py`: concatenate sequences flagged as contaminant and dubious into a single file

`filter_crosstalk.py`: use CD-HIT to remove obvious index crosstalk in samples that were multiplexed and sequenced on the same Illumina lane


### Orthofinder scripts
`summarize_orthogroup_membership.py`: parses `Orthogroups.GeneCount.csv` file to summarize ingroup/outgroup taxon occupancy in OrthoFinder-based orthogroups

`link_to_orthogroups_by_taxon_occupancy.py`: parse output of 

`summarize_orthogroup_membership.py` to create symbolic links to FASTA files of orthogroups with a minimum specified taxon occupancy

`orthogroups_to_fasta.py`: creates FASTA files from OrthoFinder's 'Orthogroups.csv' output file

### Miscellaneous
`alignment_stats_to_file_bins.py`: bin alignments by various criteria

`check_outgroups.py`: check whether multi-species FASTA file includes specified outgroup taxa

`clean_trinity_fasta_header.pl`: remove special characters, etc. from Trinity FASTA headers

`count_ortholog_types.py`

`extract_busco_summary_from_batch_outfile.py`: extract key values from batch BUSCO output into a csv file for plotting in R

`link_to_orthogroups_by_taxon_occupancy.py`

`standardize_fasta_headers_and_filenames.pl`: standardize FASTA headers among different output files

`standardize_mmetsp_headers_and_filenames.pl`: standardize FASTA headers among different output files for MMETSP data

`summarize_treeshrink.py`: summarize tips removed by [TreeShrink](https://github.com/uym2/TreeShrink)

`tip-label2taxon-label.py`: parses the taxon name from FASTA headers, following the standardized format of this dataset

`trimal_AA_to_CDS_coords.py`: convert amino acid coordinates from trimAl's #ColumnsMap output to CDS coordinates for identical trimming of corresponding CDS alignments
